# DATA

## DATA TYPES

QUALITATIVE/CATEGORICAL DATA
qualitative in nature which has no inherent mathematical significance. It is sort of a fixed value under which a unit of observation is assigned or “categorized”.

- Ordinal data: rating, groups, Gender
combination of numerical and categorical data i.e. categorical data having some mathematical significance.
- Nominal data: zip code, eye color, vehicle attributes (color, mileage, number of doors...)

QUANTITATIVE/NUMERICAL DATA
- Discrete data: number of people, number of cars, Number of times a coin was flipped, shoe sizes of people
Discrete data is the information that often counts of some event i.e. can only take specific values. These are often integer-based, but not necessarily.
- Continuous data: temperature, people height, salary, stock price
Numerical data is the information in numbers i.e. numeric which poses as a quantitative measurement of things.

# DATA STRUCTURES

Code structures for storing and organizing data that make it easier to modify, navigate, and access information. Data structures determine how data is collected, the functionality we can implement, and the relationships between data.

Operations: Accessing, inserting, deleting, finding, sorting 

Data structures help to:
- Manage and use large datasets
- Quickly search for particular data 
- Build clear hierarchical/relational connections between data points
- Simplify and speed up data processing

Most important data structures:  
- Linked List (Singly, Circular, Doubly)
- Stack
- Queue
- Heap
- Tree
- Binary Tree
