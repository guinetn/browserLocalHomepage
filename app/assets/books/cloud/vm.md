# VIRTUAL MACHINES

a simulated computer system which runs on a physical computer (a computer inside a computer.)
Virtual machines allocate memory, a virtual CPU, disk storage space, and a network interface. This means that we can have a Windows computer that runs multiple virtual machines composed of Ubuntu Linux, macOS, Windows 10, Solaris, and CentOS, and they will all be completely separate from our parent Windows operating system.

Virtualization and cloud systems are the future of computing. 
Both containers and VM’s have their pros and cons

## VM 

Virtualize the hardware thanks to a hypervisor 
Mimic and entire servers, networks, databases, etc.

A container will virtualize the operating system. Containers are generally smaller, used in a more limited way (like for testing applications before deployment), and do not have a built-in operating systems like VM’s


Virtual machines are a more cost-effective solution that allows us to control the entire workflow of an environment better, more cost effectively, and distribute resources between individual virtual machines more efficiently. There are many applications for virtualization from cloud computing to simply testing a new operating system. With the future of computers being in the cloud, virtual machines are a welcome adjunct. While both containers and VM’s have their pros and cons, the best choice for your business depends on your current project needs. However, both can be outstanding solutions to better cost-effectiveness computing. 

PRO
    Flexibility
    Hardware Cost
    Control
    Disaster Recovery
CONS
    Less Productive (do not access the hardware directly)
    Resource Consumption
    Security
