Puts storage and servers where the data is
Distributed service layers are the core of edge computing

2021: EDGE COMPUTING TO START SHOWING SIGNS OF BECOMING MAINSTREAM

Distributed information technology (IT) architecture in which client data is processed at the periphery of the network, as close to the originating source as possible.

by 2025, 75% of enterprise-generated data will be created outside of centralized data centers. The prospect of moving so much data in situations that can often be time- or disruption-sensitive puts incredible strain on the global internet, which itself is often subject to congestion and disruption.

So IT architects have shifted focus from the central data center to the logical edge of the infrastructure -- taking storage and computing resources from the data center and moving those resources to the point where the data is generated. The principle is straightforward: If you can't get the data closer to the data center, get the data center closer to the data.

Ex: servers and some storage might be installed atop a wind turbine to collect and process data produced by sensors within the turbine itself. As another example, a railway station might place a modest amount of compute and storage within the station to collect and process myriad track and rail traffic sensor data. The results of any such processing can then be sent back to another data center for human review, archiving and to be merged with other data results for broader analytics.

CLOUD COMPUTING
FOG COMPUTING
EDGE COMPUTING
All three concepts relate to distributed computing and focus on the physical deployment of compute and storage resources in relation to the data that is being produced. The difference is a matter of where those resources are located.
