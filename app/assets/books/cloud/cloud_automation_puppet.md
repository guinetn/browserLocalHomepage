* puppet master server 
stores the configuration files needed for the servers that are being managed.   
communicates constantly with puppet agents and checks if something needs to be updated/changed.   

* puppet agents 
located on the servers we are managing


Opposite to Ansible, it uses more complicated Puppet DSL’s (Domain Specific Language), so if you want to use it you need to learn its code. Luckily, there are more than 6000 “Puppet modules” you can use to quickly automate desired parts of infrastructure.
