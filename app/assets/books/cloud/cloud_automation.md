# Cloud Automation

To have a fully autonomous infrastructure  
Automating repetitive tasks improves the workflow and increases efficiency

Automate cloud-based IT infrastructure tasks (deploy, integrate, manage ) with software, tools and operations 
Automation reduces the manual effort and intervention needed to deploy a set of tasks. 

Ex: ordering a VPS  
When we placed our order BEFORE AUTOMATION WAS IN PLACE, SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO manually allocate both the hardware and software resources. We would then install the OS, cPanel/WHM, and the other default server software, and we would test to make sure everything is working correctly.
With automation, a single click perform multiple complex tasks

## Benefits 
- Agility: Businesses can scale quickly to better adapt to changing needs
- Speed: Increased deployment speed of cloud infrastructure and management
- Control: Better administration and centralized management of existing environments
- Security: Graduated levels of security provide more granularity when controlling permissions and access rights
- Resiliency: Downtime is revenue lost. The continuous monitoring of cloud services and automatic response to issues - keep business processes running smoothly
- Change Management: Improving the CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) method ensures a better - overall process cycle while lowering the possibility of software errors or a failure which increases development - stability
- Cost: The TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) of our IT infrastructure is often significantly reduced

## Cloud Orchestration: cloud automation++ 

To orchestrate and manage processes across hundreds of domains, systems, teams (execute automated tasks at an exact time across multiple nodes) 

Automation can handle tasks A, B, C automatically  
Orchestration perform them in the correct order: task C before B, and task A after B in a specific timeframe with better fault-tolerant behavior.

## Cloud Automation usage

- If a stable, continuous and permanent management of infrastructure is required
- Load balancing (routing web traffic across multiple servers to efficiency use resources)
- Development and Testing
- IaC (Infrastructure as Code): manages and deploys VM’s, cloud storage volumes, networks, load balancers, and many other available components and services. Basically, we create templates to manage all of these functions and services and allow IaC to oversee these processes.
