Full power = left turning tendency → Apply Right rudder
Full power = the feet goes in, look at the slide window
When you push the right "hand"...you push the right "foot".
When you pull the right "hand"...you pull the "foot".
[Why-when-how to lean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbR9D1Uwf2U)
LEAN BELOW 75% POWER + POH indications
1. For cruise Power settings lean above 3000' 
2. For full power settings lean above 5000'

Power-off approach: gliding the airplane
High ? Flaps
Approach geometry

Establish best glide speed.
If the runway appears to be rising, you will not make it.
If the runway appears to be sinking, you are high.

S turn. Many pilots get locked into a straight in final and get all jammed up trying to get down when a couple of shallow turns will add a lot of room to loose altitude

Slips are a great "fine tuner". However, with the limited rudder travel in most training planes a slip alone is not enough. I think the geometry is the most important part and there are very few runways where terrain is so close this is not an option. 

You should be aiming for the middle of the field so that if there is an unexpected headwind or more sink than you expect, you can still make the runway

Did he used flaps above vfe ? In that airplane you can add the first 10 below 110… But he really should’ve made it a callout “below 110 flats 10”.  C172 allows the first 10 degrees below 110 (outside the white arc)
