[Stall-Spin on final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI9T5m2eRJo)
stalls = aerodynamic events but almost all stalls are also psychological events that happen when the pilot is distracted and focuses on something else. 
- "Departure stalls" can be a focus on imminent terrain, and the pilot pulls. 
- "Approach stalls" can be a focus on overshooting a turn, and the pilot pulls. 
- "Accelerated stalls" can be a focus on a quick pullup, and the pilot pulls. 
- "Secondary stalls" can be a focus on not letting the nose drop, and the pilot pulls too much and/or too quickly.
