Listening to pilots and air-traffic controllers on the website Liveatc.com, specifically at JFK airport


Clearance for the flight plan.
Permission to start and push back.
Taxi instructions.
Departure instructions.
Take off clearance.
Hand-off from departure controller to area controller. etc etc.

example of a complex one.

SuperAir 123, cleared to Barcelona via vector departure, fly runway track, climb altitude 5000ft, after passing 2000ft turn right direct Hamm VOR, route as filed, squawk 1234, information Alpha current, startup approved

The crew might write it down like this. Each pilot develops their own preferred shorthand:

VD RWY TRK 5000 / 2000+ RT HMM / SQ1234 ALPHA / SU

Very brief since they know what each part is and the order they come in.

Since it contains instructions, the crew will then read it back.

Cleared Barcelona via vector departure, runway track 5000ft, after passing 2000ft right direct Hamm, squawk 1234, Alpha on-board, startup approved. SuperAir 123.

Finally, a good reason to write stuff down is because sometimes (and we've all been there), you think you remember, then turn round to your co-pilot 2 minutes later and ask "what was that altitude?".
