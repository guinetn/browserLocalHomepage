Airbus call out 50...40...30...20...RETARD...RETARD just prior touchdown
Radio altimeter is giving out accurate height readouts

- [V1, V2, VR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p8Pqna4t7c)
Same for SOP of MEP
V1
    = F(weight, runway length, flaps settings, runway surface contamin, engines...) 
    Speed beyond this the take-off should no longer be aborted
    Keeps hands on gaz until v1, remove after
    
Vr
    Pilot begins to apply control input to pitch up
    Point where plane has more lift than weight
    Point where nose leave the ground
    
Vlof - Lift off speed
    Point where main gear leave the ground
    
V2
    Take-off safety speed: safe climb with one engine inoperative
