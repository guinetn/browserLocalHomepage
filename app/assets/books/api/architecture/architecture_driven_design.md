## ARCHITECTURE DRIVEN DESIGNS

* TDD focuses on the implementation aspect of the system
* BDD focuses on the behavioural aspect of the system 
* ATDD focuses on capturing requirements in acceptance tests and uses them to drive the development. It seems like
* ATDD focuses on external quality of the software (does the system do what it is required to do?).
* ATDD leans towards the developer-focused side of things like [Unit]TDD does, the BDD is where the step of making
it more customer-focused comes in. This allows much easier collaboration with non-techie stakeholders, than TDD.
