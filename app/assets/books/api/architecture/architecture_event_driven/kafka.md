### KAFKA

https://kafka.apache.org/
https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/kafka

open source, distributed streaming platform which has three key capabilities:
- Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
- Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
- Process streams of records as they occur.

The Kafka project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. It integrates very well with Apache Storm and Spark for real-time streaming data analysis
