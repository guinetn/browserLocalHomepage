Standard for IoT Messaging
 
open source, lightweight messaging protocol, optimized for high-latency. This protocol provides a scalable and cost-efficient way to connect devices using a publish/subscribe model. A communication system built on MQTT consists of the publishing server, a broker and one or more clients. It is designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks.
