A proxy lets you go online under a different IP address identity.
You don’t change your Internet provider; you simple go online and search for “free proxies” or “list of proxies” and you will get several websites that provide lists of free proxies.

A proxy server is a computer on the web that redirects your web browsing activity
Amazon.com → your ISP → website/destination. Reveals your real IP address.
When you use a proxy your online requests get rerouted.
Amazon.com → your ISP → Proxy server → website/destination. Along the way, the proxy uses the IP address you chose in your setup, masking your real IP address.

- Transparent proxy
It tells websites that it is a proxy server and it will pass along your IP address anyway.
- Anonymous proxy
It will identify itself as a proxy, but it won’t pass your IP address to the website.
- Distorting proxy
It passes along an incorrect IP address for you, while identifying itself as a proxy.
- High Anonymity proxy
The proxy and your IP address stay a secret. The website just sees a random IP address connecting to it…that isn’t yours.

## Free proxies

you can find proxy servers easily for free; but as with any free service, you should be aware of the risks involved, because a free proxy may not be as safe or secure as you hope it would be. 

anyone who might intercept your data in transit could easily see sensitive information, like the usernames and passwords of your online accounts, bank and credit card details, IP address, etc. Hackers, the proxy webmaster and even the proxy owner can sell or use your data however they want, without your knowledge and not with your consent.
Proxy providers, if they’re criminally minded, can also infiltrate your sessions with viruses and spam through a lot of pop-up advertisements, which you may inadvertently click or download.

Other ways to safely hide your IP address and one of them is using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN is an alternative to a proxy, one that offers more security, more reliability, a faster internet connection and is essentially hacker-proof.
