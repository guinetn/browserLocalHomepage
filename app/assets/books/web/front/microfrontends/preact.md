3k, and provides a performant alternative to React without missing out on most features and benefits of using React.
3kb alternative to React that uses the same API with way less code (and a few less features).
Preact is an alternative implementation of React that’s built for speed. It’s a much smaller library (~3KB) that implements the same ES6 API, components, and Virtual DOM support as React. Using it instead of React means your application will have less JavaScript to download, parse, and execute.
