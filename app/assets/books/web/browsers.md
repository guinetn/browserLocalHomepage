# BROWSERS

## CHROME

Navigating your browser (for beginners)
Almost everyone I know relies on the mouse to use their browsers, it seems like hardly everyone even knows you can use Control-L to jump to the search / URL bar and type up a website URL.
Control+T will open a new tab
Control+W will close the current tab.
Control+1 through 8 will cycle through open tabs, control-9 will always jump to the last open tab to the very right.
Control+PageUp/Down will cycle through your open tabs, just PageUp/Down will allow you to scroll the page.
Speaking of scrolling the page: You can scroll down by just pressing the space bar which is easily the most convenient way to scroll down while your other hand is busy…holding the water bottle that you use to hydrate well enough and be more responsible than your peers.
Control+R reloads the page and is a little easier to reach than F5 which does the same thing.
Your URL bar is also your search bar, if you type www.google.com into your search bar to then reach for the mouse, click the already open search bar, then type the word you were actually looking for please just stop doing that.

## TOR - The Onion Router
Browser That Flies Under the Radar
https://www.torproject.org

Mid-1990s - Scientists/mathematician at United States Naval Research Laboratory, search a way  to protect their Navy’s online intelligence communications by staying anonymous and prevent others (individual, organization, foreign country) from stealing and deciphering the Navy’s communications.
2002 - Tor Project
 
Conceals your IP address every time you go online anonymously. This free process is layered with heavy-duty encryption, which means your data is layered with security and privacy protection.

Tor is a service that redirects Internet traffic through a special network that helps someone stay unidentifiable and unidentified online. An Internet inside the Internet. Tor exists to keep an Internet user’s name and identity out of Internet activity (some or all) that they don’t want their true name and actual identity attached to.

Because, sometimes people simply want to communicate online, post messages, and view websites in private, but are afraid to.

That level of freedom can be used for all the right reasons… and for all the wrong reasons.

### Onion: Tor added layers of encryption over data that was going across a network.
special stops along with the network, called relays, where a layer of encryption is pulled off, but just enough to get information the next relay destination. When the encrypted message arrives at the subsequent relay, the same thing happens—another layer is stripped and the message is moved on.

By the time the data reaches its destination, the last layer is peeled away and the information can be read. But everywhere along the way, nobody could see the data that was being transmitted. Not the contents and definitely not the IP address of the sender, which (if the person worked from one primarily locations) would identify where they were.

That also means if there were an intruder or hacker along with the network, they wouldn’t be able to know who the sender was.
