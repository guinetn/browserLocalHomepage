# TASK RUNNERS

Task runners handle automation of common project's development tasks such as 
- linting
- minification
- building
- testing 
leaving the problem of bundling to webpack

Automation of numerous development tasks such as concatenating files, spinning up development servers and compiling code.

See `npm` that has a way for you to run tasks (default or built-in tasks)

* Visual Studio → `Task Runner Explorer` 
Shows a list of available tasks and executing them is as simple as a click of the mouse. You can even bind any task to specific events that occur in Visual Studio such as Build, Clean and Project Open.
