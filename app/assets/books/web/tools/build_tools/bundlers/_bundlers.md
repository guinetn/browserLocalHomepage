# Bundlers

Task runners handle automation of common project's development tasks such as 
- linting
- minification
- building
- testing
leaving the problem of bundling to webpack

Bundlers are designed to run through all of a package's dependencies and concatenate their source into one file that (ideally) can be used in a browser. They are important to modern web development, because we use so many libraries that are designed to run with Node.
