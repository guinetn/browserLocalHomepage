static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. It builds a dependency graph that is responsible for bundling all your javascript modules into one regardless where they are located when one javascript file depends on each other.

basis of the build systems behind angular-cli and create-react-app (I believe it's in use in vue cli 3, also). This means that when you "eject" your project from those build systems, you'll end up with a webpack config file that you can run on your own.
