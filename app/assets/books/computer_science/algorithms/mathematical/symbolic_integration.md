## SYMBOLIC INTEGRATION

Computer Algebra Systems (CAS)
computer algorithms for manipulating the expressions in natural form


Mathematical expression (formula) consists of 
- constants (numbers, standard constants, Pi, Euler)
- variables (x, y, z...)
- algebraic operations (+, -, *, /...) 
- functions (sin, cos, ln, exp...)

Differentiation: a straightforward recursive algorithm to get the derivative of any expression
