# COM - Component Object Model

COM is a technology that allows objects to interact across process and computer boundaries as easily as within a single process. COM enables this by specifying that the only way to manipulate the data associated with an object is through an interface on the object. When this term is used in this documentation, it refers to an implementation in code of a COM binary-compliant interface that is associated with an object.

COM is a distributed object-oriented system for creating binary software components that can interact and communicate. As a developer, you use COM to create reusable software components and automation layers for an application. COM components can be in process or out of process, and they can communicate via a client and server model. Out-of-process COM servers have long been used as a means for inter-object communication.

a platform-independent, distributed, object-oriented system for creating binary software components that can interact. COM is the foundation technology for Microsoft's OLE (compound documents) and ActiveX (Internet-enabled components) technologies.

An interface is actually a contract that consists of a group of related function prototypes whose usage is defined but whose implementation is not. These function prototypes are equivalent to pure virtual base classes in C++ programming. 

## COM+
COM+ is an evolution of Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) and Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS). COM+ builds on and extends applications written using COM, MTS, and other COM-based technologies.
