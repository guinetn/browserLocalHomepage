### WinUI 3
an entire framework but does not sit on top of UWP
replaces the UI/Application framework of UWP

the idea is to separate the UWP UI/Application framework away from Windows. However, the whole framework isn’t what I’d classify as new – the aim is to use the same XAML as UWP (except for namespace changes) and to make it as easy as possible for developers to transition across to building WinUI3 apps and to migrate existing UWP apps across to WinUI3.
The other, probably higher, priority is to allow desktop apps to leverage the same UI/App framework. Note – by desktop we are NOT saying WinForms or WPF, we’re saying apps that run on desktop Windows outside the Windows app container.

### WinUI 2
a control library that sits on top of UWP
library of controls providing official native Microsoft UI controls and features for Windows UWP apps.
WinUI 2 can be used in any Windows 10 UWP XAML app, or in a Xamarin.Forms app running on Windows 10 using native view embedding.
