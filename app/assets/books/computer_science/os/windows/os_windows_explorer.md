### Windows Explorer

Your Windows Explorer is just like a web browser
One thing that many people don’t realize is that your Windows Explorer can be navigated just fine with the keyboard as well.
WindowsKey+E opens the thing.
Control+L lets you jump to the “URL bar” and you can start typing c://users/edgelord/”new folder(1)”/pr0n/hotneighborsunsecuredwebcamfeed
Using tab, shift, arrow keys you can select files, delete them, use F2 to rename.
