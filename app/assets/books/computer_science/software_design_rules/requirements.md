### Software Experience Lessons

Nowhere more than in the requirements process do the interests of all the project stakeholders intersect.
Without high-quality requirements, stakeholders might be surprised at what is delivered. Software surprises are almost always bad news.

When exploring requirements, think beyond the hands-on users. Your customer once removed is still your customer.
Requirements elicitation is a process of exploration, collaboration, discovery, and invention, not a simple collection process.

Two commonly used requirements elicitation practices are telepathy and clairvoyance. They don't work.
