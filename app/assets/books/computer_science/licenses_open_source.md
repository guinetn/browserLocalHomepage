## OPEN SOURCE LICENSES

https://opensource.org/licenses

Allow software to be freely used, modified and shared. To be approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), a license must go through the Open Source Initiative's license review process.

In this way, more developers can contribute and use it without any legal constraints, for personal and commercial projects.

Most open source licenses include the following statements:

- Software can be modified, used commercially, and distributed.
- Software can be modified and used in private.
- A license and copyright notice must be included in the software.
- Software authors provide no warranty with the software and are not liable for anything.
 
***Popular licenses***
- Apache License 2.0
- BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" license
- BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" or "FreeBSD" license

***Most restrictive licenses: GPL***
- GNU General Public License (GPL)
- GNU Library or "Lesser" General Public License (LGPL)

***Most permissive licenses***
- MIT license

### GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPLv3)
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html

One of the most restrictive licenses offering high protection for the author of the software.

- The source code must be made public whenever a distribution of the software is made.
- Modifications of the software must be released under the same license.
- Changes made to the source code must be documented.
- If patented material was used in the creation of the software, it grants the right for users to use it. If the user sues anyone over the use of the patented material, they lose the right to use the software.

GPLv2 is also popular, difference is the clause on patent grants that was added in version 3 to prevent companies from charging users for the use of their patents.

Projects GPLv3: Bash, GIMP
Projects GPLv2: Linux

### Apache License 2.0
https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

Offers more flexibility to the users.

- The source code doesn’t need to be public when a distribution of the software is made.
- Modifications to the software can be release under any license.
- Changes made to the source code must be documented.
- It offers the same patent usage protection as GPLv3.
- It explicitly prohibits the use of trademarked names found in the project.

Projects: Android, Apache, Swift

### BSD - Berkeley Software Distribution
BSD has two main versions, both offer more flexibility to the users than the Apache License 2.0.
- https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause
- https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause

- The source code doesn’t need to be public when a distribution of the software is made.
- Modifications to the software can be release under any license.
- Changes made to the source code may not be documented.
- It offers no explicit position on patent usage.
- The license and copyright notice must be included in the documentation of the compiled version of the source code (as opposed to only in the source code).
- The BSD 3-clause states that the names of the author and contributors can’t be used to promote products derived from the software without permission.

Projects: Go (3-clause), Pure.css (3-clause), Sentry (3-clause)
