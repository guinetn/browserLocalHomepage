## MAC - Media Access Control

World-wide UNIQUE 48-bit (6 Bytes) hexadecimal number assigned to a NIC when it is manufactured. 
The first three octets (24 bits) are known as the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) and identifies its manufacturer. It means the MAC address of all cards of a company that say X start with a particular fixed number at the beginning. 
This address is typically written as six colon/dash-separated hexadecimal numbers.
