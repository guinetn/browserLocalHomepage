# Bare Metal Programming

Develop your code, compile, jump into main and run the code. This is the purest form of embedded development, implemented directly (i.e. without a second system) on a Microcontroller. Engaging directly with peripherals, simply, concludes to better understanding of MCU internals.
***Super-loop*** is core design paradigm in embedded world. You may develop your code on an MCU with respect to this concept.
One could practice BMP by getting those development kits of various manifacturers. STM32 Development Kits would be an excellent choice thanks to its rich libraries. You can practice microcontroller internals and peripherals and some ARM-Core related concepts with such kits.
