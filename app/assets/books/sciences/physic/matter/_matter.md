Particles are excitations in quantum fields

Fundamental particles (no internal structure)
* leptons
* quarks

Composite particles (have internal structure) called hadrons
made of quarks, antiquarks, or both, bound by gluons
* Baryons
* Mesons

Anti-particules  

    Most particles have an antimatter equivalent that has the same mass
    but charge and other properties are opposite
    - positron: antielectron, charge +1
    - anti-up quarks, charge -2/3
    - anti-down quarks, charge -1/3
    - antineutrino
    - antiproton: 2 anti-up, 1 anti-down, charge -1
    - antineutron: 1 anti-up, 2 anti-down, charge 0

Exotic-particules
    hypothesized, don't have a place in this classification
    Magnetic monopoles
    WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles)

Particles are divided into 

    Fermions: building block of matter
        wich form matter:
            baryons
                large-mass particules containing 3 quarks
                - protons  2u 1d charge +1
                - neutrons 1u 2d charge  0
            leptons
                don't feel the strong nuclear force
                6 exists, only 2 are stable in ordinary matter:
                    - electron, charge -1
                    - neutrino, charge 0, hard to detect
            quarks
                feel the strong nuclear force
                6 "flavours" exists, only 2 are stable in ordinary matter:
                    - up
                    - down
                    Each can exist in any of 3 "colours"
            
    Bosons: force-carrier particles
        gauge bosons: 
            - gluon: strong force
            - photon: electromagnetism
            - Z, W Boson: weak force
            - graviton ? tought to carry force of gravity
            - W+ intermediate vector boson
            - Higgs boson
            - X-Boson ?
        mesons
            particules made of 1 quark + 1 antiquark
            - pion: 1u + 1 anti-down  charge +1
        named after Indian Physicist Satyendra Nath Bose

## DARK MATTER

Dark matter = Universe matter - [stars, visible objects] mass = invisible mass

Evidence: galaxies move faster that can be explained by the gravity of visible matter - there must be further mass present.

MACHO?: massive compact halo objects
WIMPs?: exotic subatomic particles that scarcely intercat with ordinary mater.
## DARK ENERGY

Even if dark matter deduced from observations is included, universe density is not sufficient to statify theories of its evolution. A dark energy must conteract gravity and causes universe to expand faster.

# STANDARD MODEL OF PARTICLE PHYSICS
- https://theconversation.com/explainer-standard-model-of-particle-physics-2539
- [Std model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unl1jXFnzgo)

Explain the properties of most of the particles except hypothetical graviton, tought to carry force of gravity.  
General relativity is incompatible with aspects of the standard model
Stringtherory try to unite gravity with particule physics

The standard model describes something or the way something behaves:  
***Theoretical physics*** = equations, relation between some properties we think that thing will obey.
Simplicity and symmetry of these equations.

The ultimate goal of theoretical physics would be a [“Theory of Everything”](http://www.firstscience.com/SITE/articles/kaku.asp) or a “Grand Unified Theory” but gravity doesn’t behave in a way that would fit such a theory.
 
For everything in the entire universe besides gravity, we have the “Standard Model of Particle Physics”, which describes every particle we know about and how these particles interact together via the remaining forces:
- Electromagnetism (responsible for light, electricity, magnets)
- Strong nuclear force (responsible for holding everything together)
- Weak nuclear force (responsible for radioactivity)

**STANDARD MODEL BASIC MATTER BUILDING BLOCKS**
||||
|---|---|---|
|***FERMIONS***|All of the matter that makes up your body consists of just three fermions: two quarks and an [electron](http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/welect.html)||
||**QUARKS**
||Six types of [quarks](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/particles/quark.html) in the Standard Model in order of increasing mass:
|| **UP**||
|| **DOWN**||
|| **STRANGE**||
|| **CHARM**||
||only the two lightest (up and down) are used to make protons and neutrons||
|| **BOTTOM**||
|| **TOP**||
||Put some [protons and neutrons](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/particles/proton.html) together with some electrons and you have atoms. Put some atoms together and you have matter.|
|***BOSONS***|Help other particles “communicate”, and this communication is what we call a force.|
||When two electrons repel each other, they exchange photons – the particles responsible for light – and we call this exchange the electromagnetic force.||
||Because photons are massless, they can travel a long way from the particle that emitted them.
||There are similar bosons that particles use to communicate the other forces – the exchange of heavy W and Z bosons is what we call the weak force (given that the W and Z are “heavy”, the range of the weak force is small), and the exchange of massless gluons is what we call the strong force.||
||It won’t help that the W bosons have an electric charge, so they also communicate with photons. Stranger still, the gluons have another charge called “colour” which means they can communicate with themselves.||

Now construct matter with some fermions and some bosons. We just need to write an equation that describes everything written above in a simple, symmetrical way.

![](assets/books/sciences/physic/matter/sml_small.webp)

Just as we can calculate the path of a ball through the air with a few pieces of information, the parameters in the above equation ensure the dynamics of theoretical particles match what we see in the real world.

To theoretical physicists, the above equation is beautiful, elegant, compact, and exhibits lots of the symmetries we expect to see in nature. So what’s wrong with it?

It’s not that it has a lot of terms - it needs to describe how each of the particles interacts with all the others. It’s that it needs more information.

There’s a mathematician’s quote about having too many parameters in a model:

“With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk”.

The Standard Model has 19 parameters which we fit to experiments: most of the fermion masses, and factors that determine the way certain groups interact.

One set of parameters that the Standard Model doesn’t require is the mass of neutrinos (fermions) as it predicts they are massless.
Experimentally, this is not true and, moreover, the fact they can change type of neutrino (which they have been shown to do) isn’t allowed if they are massless.
[Neutrinos](http://theconversation.com/explainer-the-elusive-neutrino-431) have other properties, too, and one of these is the way that they behave, which we call “left-handed” and “right-handed”.
Experimentally, the W bosons only interact with left-handed neutrinos, while the Standard Model predicts this interaction should be symmetric – in other words, the poor right-handed neutrinos shouldn’t miss out.

Higgs boson has been identified, is responsible for explaining the masses of the heavy fermions and bosons.

There are also some features that physicists consider to be missing from the Standard Model (apart from gravity). The biggest of these is the lack of room for [dark matter](https://theconversation.com/topics/dark-matter) particles.

###  next option?
“Beyond the Standard Model” physics covers options such as 
- supersymmetry
in which there are copies of all the particles but where fermions and bosons are swapped
- string theory
an attempt to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity.

These go some way towards rectifying some issues that the Standard Model faces, but, at present, tend to introduce further inconsistencies.

 
 
# MUONS

Studying the muon: a subatomic particle closely related to electrons, which orbit every atom and form the building blocks of matter. The electron and muon both have properties precisely predicted by our current best scientific theory describing the subatomic quantum world, the standard model of particle physics.

Generation of scientists have dedicated themselves to measuring these properties in exquisite detail.
2001: an experiment hinted that one property of the muon was not exactly as the standard model predicted, but new studies were needed to confirm

2021: new measurements confirmed new particles or forces may exist that aren’t accounted for in the standard model. If this is the case, the [laws of physics will have to be revised. https://singularityhub.com/2021/04/09/scientists-found-hints-of-new-particles-or-forces-of-nature-and-it-could-change-physics


using particle accelerators to measure a property called the magnetic moment of the muon.

Each muon behaves like a tiny bar magnet when exposed to a magnetic field, an effect called the magnetic moment. Muons also have an intrinsic property called “spin,” and the relation between the spin and the magnetic moment of the muon is known as the g-factor. The “g” of the electron and muon is predicted to be two, so g minus two (g-2) should be measured to be zero. This is what’s we’re testing at Fermilab.

For these tests, scientists have used accelerators, the same kind of technology CERN uses at the LHC. The Fermilab accelerator produces muons in very large quantities and measures, very precisely, how they interact with a magnetic field.

The muon’s behavior is influenced by “virtual particles” that pop in and out of existence from the vacuum. These exist fleetingly, but for long enough to affect how the muon interacts with the magnetic field and change the measured magnetic moment, albeit by a tiny amount.

The standard model predicts very precisely, to better than one part in a million, what this effect is. As long as we know what particles are bubbling in and out of the vacuum, experiment and theory should match. But, if experiment and theory don’t match, our understanding of the soup of virtual particles may be incomplete.

New Particles
The possibility of new particles existing is not idle speculation. Such particles might help in explaining several of the big problems in physics. Why, for example, does the universe have so much dark matter—causing the galaxies to rotate faster than we’d expect—and why has nearly all the anti-matter created in the Big Bang disappeared?

The problem to date has been that nobody has seen any of these proposed new particles. It was hoped the LHC at CERN would produce them in collisions between high energy protons, but they’ve not yet been observed.

The new measurement used the same technique as an experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, at the beginning of the century, which itself followed a series of measurements at CERN.

The Brookhaven experiment measured a discrepancy with the standard model that had a 1 in 5,000 chance of being a statistical fluke. This is approximately the same probability as throwing a coin 12 times in a row, all heads up.

This was tantalizing, but way below the threshold for discovery, which is generally required to be better than one in 1.7 million—or 21 coin throws in a row. To determine whether new physics were in play, scientists would have to increase the sensitivity of the experiment by a factor of four.

To make the improved measurement, the magnet at the heart of the experiment had to be moved in 2013 3,200 miles from Long Island along sea and road, to Fermilab, outside Chicago, whose accelerators could produce a copious source of muons.

Once in place, a new experiment was built around the magnet with state of the art detectors and equipment. The muon g-2 experiment began taking data in 2017, with a collaboration of veterans from the Brookhaven experiment and a new generation of physicists.

The new results, from the first year of data at Fermilab, are in line with the measurement from the Brookhaven experiment. Combining results reinforces the case for a disagreement between experimental measurement and the standard model. The chances now lie at about one in 40,000 of the discrepancy being a fluke—still shy of the gold standard discovery threshold.

The LHC
Intriguingly, a recent observation by the LHCb experiment at CERN also found possible deviations from the standard model. What’s exciting is that this also refers to the properties of muons. This time it’s a difference in how muons and electrons are produced from heavier particles. The two rates are expected to be the same in the standard model, but the experimental measurement found them to be different.

Taken together, the LHCb and Fermilab results strengthen the case that we’ve observed the first evidence of the standard model prediction failing, and that there are new particles or forces in nature out there to be discovered.

For the ultimate confirmation, this needs more data both from the Fermilab muon experiment and from CERN’s LHCb experiment. Results will be forthcoming in the next few years. Fermilab already has four times more data than was used in this recent result, currently being analyzed, CERN has started taking more data and a new generation of muon experiments is being built. This is a thrilling era for physics.

## THE 4 FUNDAMENTALS INTERACTIONS (FORCES)

![](fundamentals_forces.jpg)

Mediated by force-carrier particles (bosons)
    
    * Electromagnetic Force
    Governs light, electric and magnetic phenomena
    Bonds that link matter constituents are based on the EMF force
    Attract particles of unlike electrical charge 
    Repel particles of like electrical charge 
    Bind atoms, hold electrons within the shells surrounding the nucleus
    Its force carrier is the photon

    * Strong nuclear force (colour force)
    Link nucleus components together
    Holds together protons, neutrons and atomic nuclei
    Control the quarks "colour" porperty and as it operates the quarks constantly change "colour" by exhanging virtual gluons (force carrier particles)

    * Weak nuclear force
    Control a variety of nuclear interactions (radioactive decay…)
    Its force carrier are W+ W- Z0 bosons

* Gravity

## STATES OF MATTER

Differ in the particles energy and freedom particles can move relative to another. In order of common in the universe
- Plasma (in stars): a so hot gaz that collisions knocks electrons out of atoms making it made of ions + electrons moving very energetically
- Gaz: very weakly bonds, greater freedom
- Liquid: weak bound, move freely
- Solid: strong bound


A Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) is often said to be a "fifth state of matter"
