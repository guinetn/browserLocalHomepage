## RESTREINT RELATIVITY



Special Relativity: Einstein presumed that the speed is the same in any frame of reference. This was one of the postulates.
The second postulate was principle of relativity - the laws of physics are the same for all observes who are moving at the same velocity relative to each other. Einstein showed that the only way these can be true is if time was not fixed, but was relative.
