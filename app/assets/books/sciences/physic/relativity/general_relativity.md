# GENERAL RELATIVITY

Equations of general relativity capture the way in which spacetime — the very fabric of reality — bends in response to the presence of matter and energy which, in turn, explains how matter and energy move.
 
There would be no way to tell if you were in an accelerating reference frame or standing stationary on earth. A flashlight beam will bend in gravity. But since light always takes the shortest path between any two points, this means that space-time itself is bending.

## SPACE TRAVEL 
General relativity places two constraints on interstellar travel.
- 1. Nothing can be accelerated past the speed of light (around 300,000 kilometers per second). Even traveling at this dizzying speed it would still take us four years to arrive at Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to our Sun.
- 2. The clock on a spaceship traveling close to the speed of light would slow down relative to a clock on Earth (this is known as time dilation). Assuming a constant state of acceleration, this makes it possible to travel to the stars. One can reach a distant star that is 150 lightyears away within one’s lifetime. The catch, however, is that upon one’s return more than 300 years will have passed on Earth.
 
 
- Gravitational Time Shift   
To see how much longer you would live if you were to live on 1) Earth, 2) Sun, 3) White Dwarf, 4) Neutron Star, 5) the Event Horizon (at the black hole).

### warp drive

mathematics of general relativity allowed for “warp bubbles”—regions where matter and energy were arranged in such a way as to bend spacetime in front of the bubble and expand it to the rear in a way that allowed a “flat” area inside the bubble to travel faster than light.
