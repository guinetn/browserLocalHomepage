Maxwell brought together electricity and magnetism — two phenomena that were previously independent and distinct 

Maxwell’s equations predict the existence of radiation that travels at the speed of light. What those equations ⁠ — which govern classical electromagnetism ⁠ — clearly tell us are about the behavior of:
- stationary electric charges,
- electric charges in motion (electric currents),
- static (unchanging) electric and magnetic fields,
- how those fields and charges move, accelerate, and change in response to one another.

If you have a static object with a charge, it will affect only other charges. 

If you have a static magnet, it will affect only other magnets. It will not affect charges. But if you have a moving charge, it will affect a magnet. 

If you have a moving magnet, it will affect a charge. 
 
A magnetic field is created by moving charges AND MOVING ELECTRICAL FIELDS

 The constants mu naught and epsilon naught are the permeability and permittivity of free space. These two constants determine the speed of light because they measure the resistance of space to changing electric and magnetic fields.

under certain condition (empty space) they show what light is
