# ELECTRICITY

## Static electricity and charge
Repulsion

Attraction

Total electrical charge of any matter, body is a multiple of a basic quantity of charge named elementary charge. In physics electrical charge is represented with the letter q. The elementary charge has the symbol qe and has the magnitude of:
|qe|=1.60⋅10^−19 C
qe is the charge of a single electron or proton.

SI unit of electrical charge is the Coulomb (C). 1 Coulomb is defined as the amount of charge needed for each of two point-like objects, separated at a distance of 1 m, such that an attraction/repulsion force of 9.0 · 109 N occurs between them.

The number of protons needed to have a total charge of 1.0 C is:

1.0C⋅1 proton1.6⋅10−19C=6.25⋅1018 protons
The same number of electrons is needed to have a combined charge of -1.0 C.

## Charges movements

Conductors: allow free movement of electrons 
Elements that allows electrical charge to move through them relatively easy. 
Some electrons in metals are not bound to the atom and can move freely. These are named free electrons. 
ex: iron, copper, aluminium 

Insulators: do not allow free movement of electrons
They can not carry electrical charge
ex: glass, plastic, paper, wood...

## Coulomb’s Law: interaction force between electric charges

Coulomb force (F): electrostatic force / Coulomb interaction
![Coulomb's law - attraction and repulsion](assets/books/sciences/physic/assets/coulomb-law.jpg)

- Conditions
the charges must have a spherically symmetric distribution
the charges must not be in contact
the charges must be stationary with respect to each other

Between two objects with electrical charge, depending on the sign of the charges, positive or negative, the interaction force can be of attraction or repulsion.

2 electrical charges q1 and q2, separated by the distance r. Between the electrical charges there is an interaction force which is attractive if the charges have opposite signs and repulsive if both charges have the same sign (either positive or negative).

The Coulomb force is along the straight line joining them. If the two electrical charges have the same sign, the electrostatic force between them is repulsive; if they have different signs, the force between them is attractive.

F=k.q1.q2/r²

k: Coulomb’s constant/electric force constant/electrostatic constant
k=1/4πε0 = 8.987552⋅10^9 Nm²/C²
ε0: electrical permittivity of free space (vacuum). A constant
ε0=8.854187817⋅10^−12 F/m (Farad per meter)


If the electrical charges are placed in another medium, water for example, instead of using the permittivity of vacuum, we need to use the absolute permittivity ε which is the product between the permittivity of vacuum ε0 and relative permittivity εr.
ε=ε0⋅εr
k=1/4πε

Ex: 
q1 = q2 = 1.6⋅10^−19 C
r = 0.001 m
ε0 = 8.854187817⋅10^−12
εr=80.1 Relative permittivity of water at 20 °C
F = =2.872426⋅10^−24 N
