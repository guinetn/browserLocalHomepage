# ENERGY

Power is defined as energy per unit time

Work = F.d is closely related to energy. It is force times distance traveled. 

Energy for most objects consists of kinetic energy plus potential energy. KE is the energy of motion, It is KE = ½ M V² – the more mass you have and/or the more velocity you have, the more energy you have. 

Energy is always conserved. It is not created or destroyed. It only changes form. 

Gravitational potential energy is expressed as PE = m g h – mass times the gravitational acceleration times the height. The total energy of an object is both Kinetic energy plus potential energy. 

Potential energy can take many forms. Gasoline or petrol has chemical potential energy.
