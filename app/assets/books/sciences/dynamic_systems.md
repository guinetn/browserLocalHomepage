# DYNAMIC SYSTEMS

Understanding the nonlinear behaviour of complex systems 
* over time
* using stocks, flows, internal feedback loops, table functions, time delays

Methodology and mathematical modeling technique to frame, understand, and discuss complex issues and problems
SD models solve the problem of simultaneity (mutual causation) by updating all variables in small time increments with positive and negative feedbacks and time delays structuring the interactions and control.

Ex: "Limits to Growth"
This model forecast that exponential growth of population and capital, with finite resource sources and sinks and perception delays, would lead to economic collapse during the 21st century under a wide variety of growth scenarios.
