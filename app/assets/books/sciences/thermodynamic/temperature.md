### Temperature

Average measure of the kinetic energy of the particles of a defined quantity of matter (solid, liquid, gas or plasma).

All matter is made from particles (atoms or molecules) that are in constant motion. Being in motion, the particles have kinetic energy. The motion of the particles is oscillatory, like a random vibration. The higher the frequency and amplitude of the vibration, the higher is the kinetic energy of the particle.

Two bodies in contact will reach thermal equilibrium. The body with higher temperature will gradually transfer heat (particle’s kinetic energy) to the lower temperature body. After some time they will have the same temperature.

#### Celsius °C
0 °C point is the freezing point of water (at sea-level atmospheric pressure)
the 100 °C point is the boiling point of water (at sea-level atmospheric pressure)
it’s a centigrade scale because of the 100 degree interval

#### Kelvin K
International System of Units (SI) for temperature measurement (science and engineering)

0 K point is the lowest physically possible temperature that can occur (it’s called also absolute zero)
water freezing point is at 275.15 K (at sea-level atmospheric pressure)

#### Fahrenheit °F
mainly used in the USA
0 °F point is the temperature at which a solution of brine contains equal parts of ice and salt
the 32 °F point is the freezing point of water (at sea-level atmospheric pressure)
the 212 °F point is the boiling point of water (at sea-level atmospheric pressure)

T[∘C]=T[K]–273.15
T[∘C]=(T[∘F]–32)⋅5/9

T[K]=T[∘C]+273.15
T[K]=(T[∘F]+459.67)⋅5/9

T[∘F]=T[∘C]⋅9/5+32
T[∘F]=T[K]⋅9/5–459.67

-15°C = 258.15 K = 5 °F
0°F = 255.37 K = -17.78 °C
100 K = -279.67 °F = -173.15 °C

## Thermal expansion 

Shape modification (expansion/contraction) of particles in a substance function of temperature. Affect gases, liquids, solids
- linear (one direction, 1-D)
    L=L0⋅(1+α⋅ΔT)
    ΔT [ºC]: temperature difference 
    α [1/ºC]: coefficient of linear expansion of the solid 
- areal (two directions, 2-D)
- volumetric (three directions, 3-D)
ΔV=β⋅V0⋅ΔT
β: coefficient of volumetric thermal expansion. β ≈ 3⋅α   
α: coefficient of linear thermal expansion

α and β are not constant but varies slightly with temperature. Therefore, the mathematical expression can be applied only to small temperature variations.

A physical property of a substance (gas, liquid or solid) to  (length, area or volume) function of temperature. 

Ex: bridge made of steel
initial total length of 1500 m at -20 ºC
length at 40 ºC: 
    L=L0⋅(1+α⋅ΔT)
    ΔT = -20 + 40 = 60 °C
    α = 12·10^-6
    L= 1500 ⋅( 1 + 12·10^-6 ⋅ 60) = 1501.08 m
    
can cause structural problems if not taken into account in the design phase. Because of the thermal expansion, metal bridges are build up from several sections which have air gaps between them, in order to allow thermal expansion function of temperature change.

Thermal expansion has also a big impact on railway tracks. A 10 km railway track is not made up from a single piece of steel but divided into several pieces with air gaps (expansion spaces) between them. In winter the air gaps are bigger becasue the rails have smaller length and in summer the air gaps are bearly noticeable becasue the rails have increase length due to thermal expansion.

* Bimetallic Strips
is made up from two metals, bond together, with different thermal expansion coefficient. When the temperature change, because they have different thermal expansion coefficient, the length change (ΔL) of each strip will be different. Being bond together, the strip will bend function of temperature change.

Bimetallic are used as switches in electric circuits to open/close electric contacts function of external temperature or current through the circuit.
