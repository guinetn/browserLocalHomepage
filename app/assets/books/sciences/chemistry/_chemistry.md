# BRANCHES

## 1. Analytical chemistry
Determine what matter is and how much if it exists: quality of water/food, provide measurements and documentation to trade

## 2. Organic chemistry
Study of the structure, properties and reactions of compounds and materials containing carbon atoms
Life, plastics, chemical, food, paints, explosive, comsmetics...create new molecules and explore properties

## 3. Physical chemistry
Study of how matter behave on molecular and atomic level and how chemical reaction occurs

## 4. Biological chemistry
Study of structure, composition and checmical reactions of substances in living systems

## 5. Inorganic chemistry
Study of properties and behavior of inorganic compounds (without carbon atoms):
metals, minerals, organometallic compounds: pigments, coatings, medecines, fuels
High melting point, high conductivity, making them useful for specific purposes
Ammonia NH3 → nylon, polyurethane, foams, explosives
Chlorine Cl: agrochemical

## 6. Polymer chemistry
Study large complex molecules (polymers) made of smaller repeating units


# CHEMICAL BONDS

#### 1. COVALENT BOND (STRONG)
2 atoms share electrons on the extrem layer
- polar (unbalanced electron engagement)
- no polar (balanced electron attraction)
Ex: these bonds make molecules

#### 2. IONIC BOND (STRONG)
Electrons transfert from betwwen ionic (electrostatic attraction)
Ex: NaCl = Na+Cl-

#### 3. INTERMOLECULAR (VAN DER WAALS) (WEAK)
Hydrogen bound
Hydrogen has a great positive charge attracted by an electronegative atom
More weak than the 2 previous

All these bonds are stables but during a chemical reaction there are intermediate states while atoms are
