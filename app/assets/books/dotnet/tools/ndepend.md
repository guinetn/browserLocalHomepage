NDepend is a static code analyzer that is easily integrated with Visual Studio. The tool allows measuring code quality with the help of various metrics and to visualize its design. It also gives a 10,000-foot view of the application and code organization. NDepend provides a custom querying language to check out the application’s coupling, as well as gives a possibility to analyze how well code adheres to standards.
