# ncrunch

https://www.ncrunch.net/

An automated concurrent testing tool for Visual Studio. It collects code coverage while tests are executed, shows code performance metrics, runs several tests simultaneously, and prioritizes recent changes in the code.

- The distributed processing feature creates grids to run tests that can be shared between developers or even scaled into the cloud allowing development teams to pool their resources.
- Small memory footprint tunes NCrunch’s CPU and memory consumption to fit the specific needs of developers.
- Smart multiprocessor support controls the use of CPU preventing negative coding experience in Visual Studio.
- Easy debugging allows using a single context menu command or shortcut key to break the lines of code.
