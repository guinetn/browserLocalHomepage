## Interfaces

An interface is a contract that impose a behavior to be respected through a set of methods defined solely by their signatures. These methods must be implemented by the class which will implement the interface.
An interface has only 'public' mehods, no private/protected

Abstract class vs Interface:
An abstract class permits you to make functionality that subclasses can implement or override whereas an interface only permits you to state functionality but not to implement it. A class can extend only one abstract class while a class can implement multiple interfaces
