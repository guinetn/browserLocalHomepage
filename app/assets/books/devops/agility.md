# AGILITY: Team work on iterations

Iterative, incremental software development process
Make your organization more productive and efficient
Teams continuously build, test and gather feedback on their product

## 4 VALUES

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Having a solid process and set of tools is very important in Agile.
Valuing individuals and interactions over tools enables more value creation and output.
Individual team members can innovate.
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
Instead of verbose specifications and planning, just write a few lines of code that work.
Test it. Get feedback on it. Ship it.
Then, do it again. 
Repeat.
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Agile promotes a quick feedback loop to get customer and stakeholder feedback.
What could be better than working backwards from what real users and customers want?
Instead of over-analyzing what customers want through endless planning, just keep it simple. "Mitigate distractions"
* Responding to change over following a plan
Roadmaps always change, this is a known constant. 
Quick feedback loops beget rapid change and adjustments.
