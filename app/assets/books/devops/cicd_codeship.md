## CodeShip

https://codeship.com/

Hosted Continuous Integration platform. If your organization uses GitHub for version controlling systems, CodeShip could be a huge value-add. The primary reason being its capability to enable testing, build, and deployment directly from GitHub projects.

It follows a freemium pricing model where 100 builds per month are free for unlimited projects. CodeShip’s simple UI and turnkey environment make it super easy to get builds & deployments in a few minutes.
