# CD - CONTINUOUS DELIVERY AND CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT

## CONTINUOUS DELIVERY PROCESS
Developer’s changes to an application are automatically bug tested and uploaded to a repository where they can then be deployed to a live production environment by the operations team. It’s an answer to the problem of poor visibility and communication between dev and business teams. To that end, the purpose of continuous delivery is to ensure that it takes minimal effort to deploy new code. 

involves a mandatory time lag in the final release – a manual step of approving the initiation of a deploy to production.

 
## CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT PROCESS
Every change in the source code is deployed to production automatically, without explicit approval from a developer.

Refer to automatically releasing a developer’s changes from the repository to production, where it is usable by customers. It addresses the problem of overloading operations teams with manual processes that slow down app delivery. It builds on the benefits of continuous delivery by automating the next stage in the pipeline.
