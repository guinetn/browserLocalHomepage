# MD5

Was commonly used for password hashing, but now considered insecure for cryptographic purposes due to some vulnerabilities that were discovered in it

Originally designed as a secure cryptographic hash algorithm for authenticating digital signatures. Unfortunately, MD5 has been cryptographically broken and considered insecure but can be used as a non-cryptographic checksum to verify data integrity and detect unintentional data corruption.
