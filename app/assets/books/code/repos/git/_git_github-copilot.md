# GitHub Copilot 

A controversial autocomplete for developers
Will it take our jobs ?

AI-powered tool for writing code faster. It is built on top of OpenAI’s GPT-3 model and uses training data from public places like StackOverflow to suggest and write code automatically.  

GitHub's Copilot is an AI pair programming companion that draws context from the code you’re working on and suggests whole lines or entire functions. Some tech reviewers love it, saying it saves time, is "eerily accurate, and "one of the "top three tech developments of the 2020s." Others have questions about its ability to scale or are concerned that it will generate code that is identical to code under open source licenses that don’t allow derivative works

instead of making a google search...
Just write a descriptive function name or some comments
