## git squash		

To combine commits (related to one feature)

Ex: . Implement carousel slider commit 
	. Add styling to carousel commit 
	. Add buttons to carousel commit 
	. Fix strange issue in IE with carousel commit 
	. Adjust margins in carousel commit 
	It’s much easier to squash these into a single commit that says “Add carousel to homepage”.

	A reason you may not want to squash your commits could be because you are working on a very detailed and lengthy feature, and want to keep a daily history for yourself in case you come across bugs later on. Then your feature is easier to debug
