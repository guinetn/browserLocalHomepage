## Languages for distributed computing

cloud based services, virtual machines or physical clusters. But traditional languages aren’t designed for running code across many machines and accessing many different data volumes.

Erlang (Elixir)
Rust
Go

## Languages for big data and data analysis

huge datasets used in modern financial applications do not play well with older languages. Apache Spark is a framework specifically designed for working with big data. It is written in Scala, which was created to be a ‘nicer Java’, and is gaining popularity amongst risk managers.

kdb+
another database which is commonly used by high frequency traders due to it’s unrivalled ability to cope with massive sets of price data at high speed. The language q is used to pull data out of kdb+ and analyse it so that the next highly profitable trading strategy can be found.

Julia
Already making inroads into finance, thanks to a project to implement the same time series analysis found in Python’s pandas library (which I had some peripheral involvement in). High profile users of Julia include BlackRock and Aviva.


## Languages for mobile and web apps

Typescript 
is a superset of the much maligned Java Script, created by none other than Microsoft.

Kotlin
not originally developed by Google, but in 2019 it was adopted as their preferred language for Android apps. Google’s home grown product, Dart, is useful for developing applications that run across multiple platforms. Swift is the official language for Apple IOS apps.

Hack (Facebook)
Strictly speaking, this is not a separate language but a dialect of PHP. However it’s provocative name meant I couldn’t leave it out of this list, although it also makes it unlikely that it will be adopted by nervous banking CTOs.
