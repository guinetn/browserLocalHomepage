# Comments

- Short and clear: developers do not want to read books in the codebase
- Explain the why, not the what (readable code is the “what”, generally self-explanatory). The “why” can only be guessed or assumed by developers. Developers should know never to assume or guess!
- Maintain comments up to date
- Use Clear Commit Messages
- Write Readable Code: More important than comments, is to have readable code
