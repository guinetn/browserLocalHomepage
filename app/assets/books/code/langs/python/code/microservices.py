Microservices¶
Nameko, a microservices framework. https://www.toptal.com/python/introduction-python-microservices-nameko

Microservices architectural style is developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery

In other words, an application following a microservices architecture is composed of several independent and dynamic services that communicate with each other using a communication protocol. It is common to use HTTP (and REST), but as we’ll see, we can use other types of communication protocols such as RPC (Remote Procedure Call) over AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol).
