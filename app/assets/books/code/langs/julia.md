Julia- It is an open source language and community is also growing very fast. It can replace Python in data science, deep earning and machine learning world because Julia is an amazing programming language in terms of speed. Julia programs compile to efficient native code for multiple platforms via LLVM. Only issue with Julia right now is that it has less number of packages/libraries w.r.t Python so many people are still working with Python. But since Julia’s packages/libraries are also increasing, so probably in coming few years Julia will be a very big competitor of Python.
