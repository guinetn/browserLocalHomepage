sociétés innovantes qui ont pour ambition de repenser les services bancaires grâce à la technologie
Au croisement de la technologie et de la finance, du big data et des réseaux sociaux

Fintechs developed new banking technologies and business models that are driving industry-wide change.
It’s an exciting time, and the implications for the future of financial services are promising.

“We are in the midst a worldwide FinTech revolution that is changing the way we invest, raise capital, borrow, lend, pay for goods and services and save for retirement. It is reinventing currency, democratizing the flow of capital and giving rise to an entirely new generation of tech-centric financial leaders”

 FinTech Revolution is Being Driven By: 
  • TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT 
 • A PHENOMENON IN GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS 
 • A CHANGING REGULATORY LANDSCAPE 
 • THE UPRISING OF THE MASSES

 Technology is Snowballing 
 • Automation has made micro and fractional investing cheaper, simpler and more accessible 
 • Technology has made tax-deferred micro-alternative investing an economic reality 
 • It has finally democratized diversification (one of the most important and effective strategies of modern investing)
