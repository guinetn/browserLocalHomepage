Economy's 3 actors
. economic actors spend more than they earn

- Companys: Produce goods and services. Pay workers
Pay salary,interests,rents,dividends

↑ Consumption flow
Money flow: Income flow = Consumption flow = PIB = sum of all goods & services producted
            The expenses of some correspond to the income of others
            PIB: indicator macro-economic
↓ Income flow
- Houseolds: Consume goods and services (rent, shopping, exits)
  Population receive incomes (salary,interests,rents,dividends=company profit)
  
- State: Get Money to finance its expenses and incomes: Taxes Houseolds and Companys
Reinject money: 
  build roads, schools, consumme services...
  pay functionary, pension, allowance (unemployment, family, housing)


PRIMARY MARKET: 
No stock exchange, no trader, no speculation
Achat dès l'émission du titre
Savings transit by primary market to finance companys/state
Savings are converted into ACTION & DEBT PRODUCTS starts on primary market and funding state/company and can go on the second-hand market (company doesn't buy its own action or its debt products)

  * SAVINGS: more by houseolds, companyes too
  Less money in circulation = less expenses → less incomes. MUST NOT STAGNATE 
  Financial system reinjected savings 
              ↓
  * RETAIL BANK, COMMERCIAL BANKS: loan savings
    * current accounts 
    * savings accounts
    Collect savings and reinjected it as
    - real estate loan
    - consumption loan
    * monetary creation 
    
        Chaque banque a le droit de distribuer sous forme de crédit la quasi-totalité de l'argent (mais pas tout) mis en dépôt par ses clients sur les comptes à vue. Mais ce crédit distribué par la banque N'ANNULE PAS POUR AUTANT LE DÉPÔT, qui reste disponible pour le client. Il y a donc création de monnaie par la banque
        
        croissance = PIB ↑
          * more money flow (undergoes parameter)
          * faster money flow 
            loan = monetary creation: bank loan more money than all its accounts (speculation bubble)
            = debt creation (bet on futur) = instement on riches creation
            MUST COMPARE DEBT LEVEL/INCOME = DEBT/PIB
            
    WANT MORE INTEREST THAN RETAIL BANK
    Entrust your savings
    ↓
    
  * INVESTMENT FUNDS (public or private); get some savings to invest it on financial markets

    - Sovereign Fund: invest states savings (1st is Norvege)
    - Pension funds: invest households savings for retirement
    - Hedge Funds: get savings + borrow money for lever effect (maximize) 

    Are sellers of financial products when their clients want money back
    Are buyers of financial products when their clients want to invest
    Liquidity: speed at wich we can sell/buy a financial product. More liquid, more fast to convert it from financial product ←→ money

  * FINANCIAL MARKETS: link Investment Funds and states/companys (big loans)
    Helps Companys/State to emit DEBT PRODUCTS (BUY BY INVESTMENT FUNDS) as 
    - Bonds
    - Treasury bills billets de trésorerie
    - Deposit certificates certificats de dépot
    Contract a loan (amount, interest rate, recovery date)

    Companys emit action (only private company can, it's a property title, not a debt)
    action can be sold with a benefit, yearly dividends

  * INVESTMENT BANK
    BFI: investment and funding bank 
    
    Clients: 
      * States/Companys
        intermediate that give advice on what to be done: emit debt or action, manage complex financial instrument emission
      * Investment funds    
        Traders works for bfi in market rooms
        Make investment funds exchanges fluid

SECONDARY MARKET: SOLVE LIQUIDITY PROBLEM
ACTION & DEBT PRODUCTS starts on primary market and funding state/company and can go on the second-hand market

Speculation (préméditation) vs Liquidity (unplanned event)
Speculation brings liquidity to investisors

DERIVED PRODUCT
  Only on secondary market
  Not to finance economy
  Insure many risks
  Bet / insurance policy: insured ← → insurer
    insured get money if an event happen
    insurer protect insured
    Ex: action 50$ insured for 6 month
        if 40$ at the end (6 months) then insurer will pay 10$
        insurer receive 0.5$ per month for the 6 months of coverage
  
  
EXPORTATION: we get money for things we sold in others countries
IMPORTATION: we pay for things we buy in others countries
TRADE BALANCE
  deficit: money leave the country. BUT
    - foreign investment: when has €, must reinvest in € (debt/action of FR company)
    - monetary creation by commercial bank
    So if PIB is growing, we don't loose money
