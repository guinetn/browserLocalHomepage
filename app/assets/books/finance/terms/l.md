## Leverage
Leverage and gearing effectively mean the same thing: the process or effect of ‘gearing up’ or magnifying exposure to an investment strategy, manager or asset. 
Leverage can be achieved by borrowing capital or using derivatives. A leveraged investment is subject to a multiplied effect regarding the profit or loss that results from a comparatively small change in price. Thus leverage offers the opportunity to achieve enhanced returns, but at the same time typically involves greater risk and can result in a loss that is proportionally greater than the amount invested.
