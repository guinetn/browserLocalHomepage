### Obligation - Bonds
Titre de créance représentant la part d’un emprunt à long terme émis par une personne morale.

A security that pays a specific level of interest (Fixed income)

Bonds are tradable instruments (debt securities) which are issued by a borrower to raise capital. They pay either fixed or floating interest, known as the coupon. As interest rates fall, bond prices rise and vice versa.

Obligation convertible : Une obligation convertible est une dette financière détenue par l’obligataire contre une entreprise, avec la possibilité pour lui d’échanger son obligation contre une ou plusieurs actions de la société émettrice. L’obligation convertible s’assimile à une obligation classique avec une option d’achat sur des actions nouvelles de l’émetteur. Le porteur de l’obligation n’a pas l’obligation d’exercer son droit.

Coupon accrued				Coupon couru 

* Convertible bond
A bond issued by a company that has a set maturity date and pays interest in the form of a coupon. It has features of both a bond and stock and its valuation reflects both types of investments. It gives the holder the option to convert the bond into a specific number of shares of the issuing company – in other words, it has an 'embedded option'.

* Catastrophe bonds
These securities package a risk of catastrophic events such as earthquakes or hurricanes into a bond. These bonds typically pay a spread over 3-month LIBOR, but if the insured event occurs the issuer is relieved of the obligation to pay the interest and/or principal amount.

* Zero coupon bond
A bond bought at a discount from its face value which offers the entire payment at the time of maturity. Unlike other bonds, it does not make periodic interest payments, hence the name ‘zero coupon bond’.

Derivative: A contract that changes in value in relation to the price movements of a related or underlying security, future or other physical instrument. Option is the most common derivative instrument. 

A derivative instrument [see Derivatives] that gives the holder the right, without obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a security or asset at a fixed price within a specified period or at a particular future date.

Two types of options:

### A call
right to buy. Protect  

### A put
right to sell. One can write or buy call and put options. 

Put option is a derivative instrument which gives the buyer of the option (holder) the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a fixed price (exercise or strike price) after a specified period of time (on maturity for European and anytime before maturity for American option). The seller of the put option (put writer) has a contingent obligation to purchase the underlying asset if the put holder wishes to exercise the option. As the option gives the buyer a choice to exercise the option or not, the seller charges a fixed upfront fee from the buyer (known as premium).

Example: ABC is an American company with a project in Australia. It has some account receivables in Australian Dollar (AUD) which will be realized after 3 months. The USD value of this receivable will reduce if AUD depreciates. It can purchase put options on AUD with a 3 months maturity to sell the AUD at a fixed exchange rate after three months.
