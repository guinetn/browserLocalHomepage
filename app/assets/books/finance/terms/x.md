A primary role of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is to ensure that investors have reliable information with which to make decisions. To this end, the SEC requires that publicly-traded corporations submit reports that accurately portray their financial state. Corporations have traditionally provided these reports in regular text, but as computerized stock analysis became popular, the SEC decided on a more structured, computer-readable format.

The SEC selected the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) for structured corporate reporting. As of April 2009, the SEC requires that corporations provide financial reports in XBRL format in addition to text. Since then, India and the United Kingdom have also adopted XBRL for corporate reporting.

XBRL is based on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), but uses special tags to mark financial data. This section presents the basics of XML and namespaces, and then provides an overview of XBRL.
