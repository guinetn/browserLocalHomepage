## How FX Trading works
It´s a market: B/S	
Buying of one currency and simultaneous selling of another. 
Buy/sell currency in order to profit from currency rates fluctuations
In forex, traders attempt to profit by buying and selling currencies by actively speculating on the direction currencies are likely to take in the futur
Buy one currency and sell another in the same time = "currencies pair", ex: EUR/USD
Most major FX is quoted against the US Dollar. 
OTC (over-the-counter) market

FX rates are uniform worlwide (same in NY/Hong-Kong)

No control by external entities
. Central banks interfere once a decade at max 2% for only few hours

## CONCEPTS : MARGIN AND LEVERAGE

Tools to control trading positions that are substantially greater in size than would be the case without the use of these tools. 

***Margin***
Amount of money in a trader's account that is required as a deposit in order to open and maintain a leveraged trading position.
Required margin: minimum account balance to hold a position
 
***Leverage:***
Allow to control larger positions with a smaller amount of actual trading funds. 
50:1 leverage (2% margin required): $1 in a trading account can control a position worth $50.

"double-edged sword": potential profits/losses are magnified according to the leverage degree used

Base Currency
 ↓	Counter side (right place)
 ↓	 ↓
USD/CAD trade:
- buy or sell a 100,000 of USD/CAD without leverage would require $100,000 in account funds
- 50:1 leverage (or 2% margin required), only $2,000 of the trader's funds would be required to open and maintain that $100,000 USD/CAD position 
- Profit or loss of around $10 per one-pip move in price

## pips

Currency prices move in tiny increments: so quoted in pips or % in point
A pip refers to 
* The fourth decimal point of a price that is equal to 1/100th of 1%
EUR/USD=1.5220  0 pips		1.5220+1 pip = 1.5221
* JPY: two places after the decimal
88.57 +3 pips = 88.60

|EUR/USD| Variation | Exchange rate raise/lower by pips | 
|---|---|--- | 
|1.0717 → 1.0718|0.0001 USD|+1 pip|
|101035|1.1025| -10 pips|   
|USD/JPY| Variation | | 
|106.20|106.40|+20 pips|   
|106.05|105.95|-10 pips|   

***Pip Value = (Size of a pip) x (Base Currency)***
EUR/USD: $1 USD = (1 pip) x (10,000 €)
1 pip is valued at $1USD per 10,000 traded

Buy 10,000 € against the U.S. dollar (EUR/USD) at 1.10550 
You earn $1/pip increase
If you sold at 1.10650 (+ 10 pips), you would make +$10
If you sold at 1.10450 (- 10 pips), you would make -$10

USD/JPY
***Pip Value = (Size of a pip) / (Exchange rate) x (Base Currency)***
0.94 USD = 1 pip / (106.20) x (10,000 $) 

buy 10,000 $ against the Japanese yen at 106.20 and you earn $0.94 for every pip increase in your favor. 
Sold at 106.40 (+ 20-pips) you would make +$18.80	
Sold at 106.00 (- 20-pips) you would make -$18.80	
	
### pips value

Value of a pip varies based on the currency pairs that you are trading and depends on which currency is the base currency and which is the counter currency.

	1 pip = transaction amount / 10,000
	1 pip = transaction amount / 100 	(JPY)

	EUR/USD=1.5220
	Buy €100,000 ? 152,200$
	On 10,000 €:  1.5220 ? 1.5221    1 pip = $1

	In a transaction of €10,000 		1 pip = $1 
	In a transaction of €100,000  		1 pip = $10 
	In a transaction of €1,000,000 		1 pip = $100

	    Spread size

	    	EUR / USD 
			The purchase price — the selling price = 3 pips
			The transaction size €100,000 
			€100,000 / 10,000 = $10 
			Total commission on spread: $10 x 3 = $30 

        
EUR/USD fluctuation is 0.7-0.8% a day
