# .Net 5.0

- November 2020
- There is No More .NET Core, it’s .NET 5
- Traditional platform .NET Framework will still be supported. Current .NET Framework version 4.8 won’t evolve but some security patches will be provided 
- .NET 5 ecosystem is still based on all previous versions of .NET Core - it’s the next logical iteration, with a dash of WinForms/WPF inclusion, faster algorithms and a bit of a rebranding.

For the first time, one BCL-based framework will handle all app models:

- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- Blazor
- WinForms
- WPF
- UWP
- Xamarin (switch from Mono BCL to join other components leveraging the .NET Core BCL)
- ML.NET
