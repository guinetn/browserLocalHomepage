# HIGGS BOSON 

Nicknamed “the God particle”
Discovered in 2012 at CERN after 50 years of looking for it
Final elementary particle predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics
It gives mass to other elementary particles

1960: Standard Model problem: it predicts bosons elementary particles shouldn't have mass – but observations show they do
1964: mechanisms for how they gain mass
    
    a quantum field uniformly pervades the universe. Bosons feel this field, which slows them down and in the process, gives them mass. A new boson mediat this field
    Peter Higgs is one of the physicists who proposed it

2012: Cern LHC (Large Hadron Collider) 
Found a particle consistent with the predicted properties of the Higgs boson. 
Further CERN experiments showed that all measurements of the Higgs boson (spin, parity, mass, interactions with other particles) agreed with the predictions of the Standard Model.
