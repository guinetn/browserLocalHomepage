## Be leader in Software Engineering

* 1. Career junior  
learn as much as you can, make mistakes and innovate   
Ask yourself a lot of questions and try to solve complex problems
Surround yourself with talented people and mentors who can push you to your limits
Work hard and learn fast.
At this stage, you will grasp multiple programming languages, different domains front-end or back-end. Understand the influence and usability of each technology which you face and understand when or why they are used.

* 2. Midyear experience: work/attitude maturity  
Understand and implement system design and architecture
test cases are essentials
collaborating with other engineers
Map problems to design patterns and focus on scalability
Breathing in GOF design patterns, software architecture, and scalability.

* Senior 
Focus on business needs, learn processes and leadership. Help your colleagues to produce better quality work. Lead by example by solving business-related problems and mapping them to tech solutions. Document more than coding itself, focus on the customer or business needs and try to find a fit tech solution not a best tech solution. Collaborate with other domain people, build business requirements, tech documents, code reviews and help others to grow. Organize and participate in tech discussion, retros, and sprint planning. Last but not least train yourself to be emotionally intelligent and work on communication skills.



• Programmer: anyone who can write working programs to solve problems, given a sufficiently detailed problem statement.  I have no use for programmers.

• Good programmer: a programmer who collaborates with others to create maintainable, elegant programs suitable for use by the customer, on time and with low defect rates, with little or no interpersonal drama.  I can never get enough good programmers.

• Great programmer: a good programmer who understands algorithms and architectures intuitively, can build self-consistent large systems with little supervision, can invent new algorithms, can refactor live systems without breaking them, can communicate effectively and cogently with non-technical staff on technical and non-technical issues, understands how to keep his or her ego in check, and can teach his or her skills to others.  I need a few great programmers on a team, but they're overkill for many programming tasks.
The path of becoming a great programmer is to start by being a programmer, then develop the skills needed to be a good programmer, then practice those skills until you master them, then develop the skills needed to be a great programmer, then practice those skills until you master them. 

The amount of time this takes depends on your personal skills, personality, and training.  It also depends on the experience and opportunities that you have during your career, and how you react to them.

    Do the best programmers use the fewest lines of code?

    Unskilled programmer writes concise code that does not handle edge cases, and thinks himself brilliant
    Skilled programmer writes longer code that handles edge cases, and worries that he's missed some
    
## SOFT SKILLS

* Empathie
intelligence émotionelle: comprendre l'autre dans sa réalité

* Audace
comportement associé au leader = oser mais pas 'au culot' (effronté)
esprit d’initiative

* Sens du collectif
être au même rythme et s'écouter (XV de France…)

* Motivation
Trouver du sens à ce que l'on fait. Enthousiaste = communicatif

* Gestion du temps et du stress
Prioriser pour ne être submerger = mauvais stress
Bon stress 'ponctuel': délivre de l'énergie

* Réactivité
Pas vitesse, c'est parce que tu es à fond que ça ira plus vite

rigueur

autonomie

excellent relationnel

ouverture d’esprit

esprit de synthèse
goût du partage d'expérience
