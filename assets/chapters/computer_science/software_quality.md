# SOFTWARE QUALITY

Series of practices for our teams to follow in order to assure a high-quality process and, in the end, a high-quality product.

## Key Ingredients


### strong quality assurance process = quality

This save both money and time and to create a stable and competitive product

* Team organization
affects its efficiency
meetings = check original scope deviation (= precious time lost on unnecessary discussions)  
know exactly what needs to be done in order to make a structured plan

* Team efficiency tools (great impact):
strong knowledge sharing process   
reliable documentation  

* Make client aware of all the efforts made for assuring the quality of the production

### Development  

* security 
   constantly have in mind

* code management
    code guidelines   
    review process
    code analyzing tools (Sonar)
    repositories: well-established workflows
        
### TESTING  

Performed for every level in the development cycle: 
- unit
- integration
- system
- acceptance

Having these as a regular activity in the development cycle of every feature will most certainly reduce the number of defects and assure that the application behaves as expected. Introducing 

Manual testing
Automation testing 
    automating the UI and API of all our projects
    increase the efficiency of the testing process
    reduce the time spent on regression

### Operability  
    
    assures a high quality of the product and services after the development has finished and the application is used in real life.

    Continuous deployments increase productivity
    well-structured logging systems to investigate issues
    monitoring system sending signals whenever a problem appears (Apache Airflow to schedule and monitor workflows)
    
### Data security  

    care about privacy and confidentiality = rules to follow when it comes to data
    - use dummy data on the development environments
    - restricted access to the production environments 
    - use encryption
    - minimize the use of personal data (also instructing our clients to do so)

### RESULTS
Gain client recommendations
