# Learning = repeat, review

1. Learning occurs because of repetition
2. Learners must connect new knowledge to previous knowledge in order to learn
3. Using images wherever practical is a benefit, because our brains are better at remembering images than words.

Learning way | Retention rate
---|---
Reading|10%
Listening|20%
Seeing|30%
Seeing + Listening|50%
Saying + Writing|75%
Doing|75%
Teach to others|90%

## Exponential Forgetting curve
 
R = e^(-t/s)
* R: Retention
* s: Memory strength
* t: Time

After learning something, your memory will decline over time unless we review it. More review = more the memory
When exposed to the same materiel, it take less time to write in long-term memory

FlashBulb memories: vividly imprinted in mind, easily remember (ex: 9/11)

## learn for any given subject
* Read a book
* Do a course
* Follow someone
* Join an open source project
* Develop your own project
* Do a certification
* Find a mentor or be a mentor

Skill acquisition
70%: at working on it
20%: by interact with others
10%: in training

Technology fast pace effects:
* Usable memorized knowledge is decreasing
* In memory professional knowledge
- 1986: 75%
- 2006: 10%

* Step 1. Choose the concept you want to understand.
Take a blank piece of paper and write that concept at the top of the page.
* Step 2. Pretend you’re teaching the idea to someone else.
Write out an explanation of the topic, as if you were trying to teach it to a new student. 
When you explain the idea this way you get a better idea of what you understand and where you might have some gaps.
* Step 3. If you get stuck, go back to the book.
Whenever you get stuck, go back to the source material and re-learn that part of the material until you get it enough that you can explain it on paper.
* Step 4. Simplify your language.
The goal is to use your words, not the words of the source material. If your explanation is wordy or confusing, that’s an indication that you might not understand the idea as well as you thought – try to simplify the language or create an analogy to better understand it
