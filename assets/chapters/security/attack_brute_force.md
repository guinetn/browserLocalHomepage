# BRUTE FORCE ATTACK

Attack by looping over the possibilities to decode sensitive data
To crack password / encryption keys / api keys / ssh keys
Done by bots/scripts targeting a website connection page
Try by combine word/digits...

Have a strategy to mitigate this attack: ip banish, 2 factors auth., complex passwords
Security level = F(brute_force_penetration_time)
