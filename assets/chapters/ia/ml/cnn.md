# CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks

* image recognition
* self-driving cars

 work by  
 taking the RGB numbers of each pixel of an image as input.   
 apply a filter to an image at each layer
    m-by-n matrix and works by multiplying each m-by-n rectangle of pixels by whatever corresponding numbers are in the matrix and adding the results together to create a new, smaller set of pixels that the network performs on which the network performs its operations. Each filter allows the CNN to ‘learn’ something different about images. For example, some filters isolate edges between different objects in the image, while others remove colors from the image and just look at the shape of the image’s contents.
