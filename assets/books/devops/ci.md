# CI - CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION

Successful CI means app's new code are regularly built, tested, and merged to a shared repository. It’s a solution to the problem of having too many branches of an app in development at once that might conflict with each other.

CI Principle: every change should be immediately tested before integrating it with the rest of the code. This is performed in a dedicated testing environment, either locally/QA/UAT environment. 

Practice of automatically testing each code revision before deploying it to production: speed up developments and releases into production.

seamless integration with GitHub: Travis CI, CircleCI, Semaphore

CI/CD tools that can be integrated with different cloud providers. Some of the CI/CD DevOps tools are built on Kubernetes, and we recommend having a look at the same, as these tools are evolving with time.

When opting for a CI/CD pipeline tool, it is essential to look at whether it offers on-premises and cloud-based options. As many CI/CD tools are open-source, you have to make a conscious decision whether to opt for an open-source tool or one with a commercial license.
When working with websites and web-apps, it is essential to ensure that the optimal user experience is offered, independent of the browser (or its version) and platform that is used to access the same. CI/CD tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis CI, GitLab CI, etc. that can be integrated with cross browser testing (CBT) tools like LambdaTest can accelerate the CBT activity.
