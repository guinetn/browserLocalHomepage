## Atoms
Everything is made of matter, start splitting it to smaller pieces we end up to the smallest possible piece which can not be anymore split, the atom: smallest, finite constituent of matter

An atom is made of 3 subatomic constituents:

Nucleus of the atom
* protons
positive electric charge
* neutrons
no electric charge
The protons and neutron are kept together by a nuclear forces

* Electrons
negative charge
are moving around the nucleus in an electron cloud

Lithium atom: 3 protons, 3 neutrons, 3 electrons

Nucleus 
is positively charged and the electrons are negatively charged. The electrons are attracted to the protons within the nucleus through a electromagnetic force.
The number of protons and neutrons within the nucleus are similar, without big differences.
The nucleus contains more than 99 % of the atom’s mass. 
The mass of the electron is negligible in comparison with the mass of the nucleus.
The number of protons gives the atomic number of the element. In the case of lithium, the atomic number is 3.

### He: helium atom

2 protons (atomic number = 2) + 2 neutrons + surrounding electron cloud (2 electrons which can be found anywhere in the electron cloud, the darker the area the higher the probability to be found there)
 
## Element
is made of only one type of atoms
A macroscopic sample of particular type of element is made of a very large number of atoms, all of the same type, with identical chemical properties.

copper element: a small copper coin, it made of ~ 3·10^22 copper atoms.

## Isotope

variant of the same chemical element with `a different number of neutrons`. For a given chemical element all isotopes have the same number of protons and electrons but different number of neutrons.

For example, the most common isotopes of hydrogen are:
protium (1H)
1 proton, 1 electron and no neutron. It’s the most abundant form of hydrogen that can be found in nature. Almost 99.9895 % of the occurring hydrogen is protium.

deuterium (2H)
1 proton, 1 electron and 1 neutron.  It’s also found in nature but very scarce, about 0.0105 % of the hydrogen isotopes is deuterium.

tritium (3H)
1 proton, 1 electron and 2 neutrons. It’s radioactive, decaying in time, with a half-life of around 12 year. Occurs naturally but in limited amounts (traces).

other hydrogen isotopes exists, with higher numbers of neutron. These don’t occur in nature but are synthesized in the laboratory and have a very short life duration.

## Molecule

When we join together two or more atoms we get a molecule. The atoms which form a molecule can be of the same element (homonuclear) or a combination of different elements (heteronuclear).

oxigen (O2): homonuclear, made of 2 atoms of oxigen
hydrogen (H2): homonuclear, made of 2 atoms of hydrogen
water (H2O): heteronuclear. One atom of oxigen and two atoms of hydrogen. From the electrical point of view molecules are neutral, they don’t have any charge.

## Ion
An atom/molecule with the same number of protons and electrons is neutral, doesn’t have any positive or negative charge.

An ion is an atom or molecule for which the total number of electrons is not equal with the total number of protons.

Loses one or more electrons: end up with a positive charge
`cation`: an ion with positive charge

If the atom/molecule gains one or more electrons, it will end up with a negative charge
`anion`: an ion with negative charge
