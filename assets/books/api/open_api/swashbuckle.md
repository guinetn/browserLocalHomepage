https://www.nuget.org/packages/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/

The most popular OpenAPI-generating package for ASP.NET Core
Used not only by the Swagger Codegen project, but also by the ASP.NET Core 5 Web API templates (catch the HTTP APIs session from .NET Conf where we highlight these updates to the Web API template). Swashbuckle emits Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, and 3.0 YAML, and can output the Swagger UI test page to make testing and documenting your APIs easy.
