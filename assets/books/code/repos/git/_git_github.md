popular bug trackers
provide the owners of a repository the ability to organize, tag, and associate issues to milestones.
If you open an issue on a project managed by someone else, it will stay open until either you close it


## SOCIAL CODING

		Participate in the rich open-source community
		Cloning a repo to try it out should be second-nature to you, and you should understand how to use branches on collaborative projects.

## SOCIAL CODING
FOLLOW
    you can follow a developer or a repository
    the activity will show up in your dashboard
    you see what people do.
STARS
    star a repository. This action will include it in your “starred repositories” list, which allows you to keep track of projects you find interesting and discover similar projects.
[Trending page](https://github.com/trending)
        features the repositories that get the most stars in a determined period of time 
FORK
    indicator of a project is the number of forks.
    a fork is the base of a Pull Request (PR), which is a change proposal. A person may fork your repository, make some changes, and then create a pull request to ask you to merge those changes.

MONITORING
    Monitor the impact of your code changes. Measure performance, track errors, and analyze your application.
CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
    Automatically build and test your code as you push it to GitHub, preventing bugs from being deployed to production.
CODE QUALITY
    Automate your code review with style, quality, security, and test-coverage checks when you need them.

## WEBHOOKS AND SERVICES
GitHub offers many features that help the developer workflow

WEBHOOKS
    Webhooks allow external services to be pinged when certain events happen in the repository, for example when code is pushed, a fork is made, or a tag was created or deleted.
    When an event happens, GitHub sends a POST request to the URL we tell it to use.
SERVICES
    GitHub services, and the new GitHub apps, are 3rd party integrations that improve the developer experience or provide a service to you.
    For example, you can setup a test runner to run the tests automatically every time you push some new commits, using TravisCI. https://travis-ci.org/
    You can setup Continuous Integration using CircleCI. https://circleci.com/
    You might create a Codeclimate integration that analyzes the code and provides a report of “Technical Debt” and test coverage. https://codeclimate.com/
