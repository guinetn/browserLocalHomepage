# STL - Standard Template Library

C++ built in library 

***STL consists of 4 major parts***

## 1. CONTAINERS  
Data structures to store objects of the same type, with basic functionality (insertion, removal, lookup)  
Classes, objects of which are used to store other objects of the same type

**vector, list, set, map, unordered_set, unordered_map**

They are all containers, so generally they do the same thing. They provide interfaces to insert, remove and find elements in them, but these they do in a very different way, with different complexities and using different amount of memory.

## 2. ALGORITHMS  
set of helpful and reliable algorithms

## 3. ITERATORS  
objects mostly used to apply make algorithms work on containers, also to iterate and manipulate the data in the containers

## 4. FUNCTORS  
objects, that behave like functions, and are used by algorithms
