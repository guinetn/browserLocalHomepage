“most-loved programming language”
For systems that emphasize parallelism, speed, memory safety
Designed with safety in mind
Good at running concurrent code
Users of C++ will find it very familiar.

built from scratch to incorporate multiple design elements from other mature systems programming languages

Applications
IoT: from operating systems, gaming engines, file systems, web browser components, and new simulation engines for virtual reality.
Rust directly interacts with the memory and hardware, it is an ideal language for embedded systems and bare-metal development. 
Rust can write extremely low machine-level code, making it ideal for working with microcontroller applications or OS kernels. Machine code is the language that is as close as possible to what the server’s CPU can run. 

## Rust Ecosystem
- Standardized compiler 
- built-in package manager and builder
- a testing system
- a documentation generator


### Cargo
Rust package manager
Can auto-generate documentation, run tests, and upload packages to a repository. 
It also downloads and installs multiple third-party packages with ease.
