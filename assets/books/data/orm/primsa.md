# Prisma

https://www.prisma.io/

 open-source ORM for Node.js and TypeScript. It is used as an alternative to writing plain SQL, or using another database access tool such as SQL query builders (like knex.js) or ORMs (like TypeORM and Sequelize). Prisma currently supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server and SQLite.

While Prisma can be used with plain JavaScript, it embraces TypeScript and provides a level to type-safety that goes beyond the guarantees other ORMs in the TypeScript ecosystem. You can find an in-depth comparison of the type-safety guarantees of Prisma and TypeORM here: https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/more/comparisons/prisma-and-typeorm#type-safety
