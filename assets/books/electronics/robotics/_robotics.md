# ROBOTICS

integration of core disciplines to create spellbinding machines which may gradually learn how to mimic human ethics, behavior, and qualities
Robots can learn, navigate, and make decisions all by themselves. 

## Sensors : robot Components
reduce the need for interaction, hence increasing the autonomous levels in a system
will detect an input from a source, and it will respond to it with a certain output. Overall, a sensor will convert any non-electrical physical or chemical quantity into electrical signals. The input of a sensor needs to be maintained for you to have a consistent output- 

The Tesla vehicle makes use of Ultrasonic sensors to assist with wheel alignment and centering on the road, along with LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) for object detection, sound sensors for detecting objects in the vehicle’s vicinity, cameras for computer vision, machine learning, and other advanced technology. All these sensors are responsible for creating the autonomous vehicle that we see on the roads.

- Light sensors
 converts light frequency into electrical signals, i.e., the output of these sensor signals. The signal tells us the intensity of the light being detected. It works by measuring the electromagnetic waves that exist in all (infrared, visible, ultraviolet) frequencies of light.
 
– Temperature sensors

– Pressure sensors

– Position sensors

– Hall sensors

– Flex sensors

– Sound sensors
detects and converts sound waves into electrical signals. The microphone’s diaphragm must be in functioning condition. This is because
sound waves that travel in the air medium, strike the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate and change the capacitor readings. The capacitor readings are converted into digital signals which may be used for processing purposes.

– Ultrasonic sensors
will convert reflected sound waves into electrical sensors. The Ultrasonic sensors have the ability to measure the distance between objects. The ultrasonic sensor has a transmitter and a receiver that are in-built. The transmitter will send out a sound wave in the form of piezoelectric signals and the receiver will read the sound waves after the process of reflection has occurred.

– Touch sensors

– PIR sensors

– Tilt sensors

– Gas sensors

- Motors
DC (Direct Current) Motor 
likely have wheels connected to the output end -  mechanical energy being outputted will be used to turn the wheels. 
Input: electric current 
Output: mechanical energy or motion
Components within the DC motor includes: coil winding, magnets, rotors, brushes, stator, source current.
When the coil is powered (a current is passed through it) 
→ a magnetic field is generated around the coil
→ this causing the coil to interact with the magnets
→ triggering the coil to rotate
→ ultimately outputting mechanical energy

- Power Switch
To power it on/off, a power breaker for the robot, allowing the current to stop flowing in the circuitry and allowing the components to cool down. 

- Transistor
Semiconductor that has two functions: either act as a switch, or as an amplifier to current
As a switch, the transistor will reduce the current on one side of the leads and increase the current on the other side. 
As an amplifier, the transistor will accept current into one lead, and output it from the other at a higher current.

- Resistor
Implement resistance in your circuit to reduce the flow of current, divide voltage, adjust the levels of electrical signals.
