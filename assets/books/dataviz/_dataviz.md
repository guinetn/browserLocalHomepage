### The 5 Gestalt principles applicable to data visualization

Gestalt is an influential human psychology theory, developed by German psychologists, Max Wertheimer (1880–1943), and his colleagues, Kurt Koffka (1886–1941) and Wolfgang Kohler (1887- 1967)

The theory deals with the details of how our brains create structure by default. It has a profound effect on the meaning of the information presented. The German word ‘gestalt’ means ‘unified whole’ in English and is generally associated with the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
