A hedge fund is an investment fund—a financial organization which raises funds from investors and places them in short-term and long-term investments, or in different financial products. It is typically formed as a limited partnership or a limited liability company. A hedge fund’s goal is to maximize returns. A return is a gain or loss in the hedge funds’ net worth over a particular time period. It is generally accepted that when more risk is taken, there is greater potential for higher returns and losses.

In order to achieve good returns, hedge funds rely on various types of investment strategies, trying to make money by exploiting market inefficiencies. Due to various kinds of investment strategies that are not allowed in ordinary investment funds, hedge funds are not registered as funds, i.e., they are usually not supervised by the state like other funds. They don’t need to publish their investment strategies and business results, which can make them quite risky. Some hedge funds generate more money than the market average, but some of them lose money. Some of them bring permanent results, while some of the hedge funds’ results are variable.

### History of Hedge Funds
The first hedge fund appeared in 1949, established by former writer and sociologist Alfred Winslow Jones. It was while he was writing an article about current investment trends for Fortune, back in 1948.
He tried to manage the money and was very successful. He raised money using his investing innovation, which is now widely known as long/short equity. The strategy is still very popular among hedge funds. Shares can be bought (buy: long) or sold (sell: short).

When the price of a share is low and it is expected that the price of a share will go high, it is logical to buy a share (long) and sell it (short) as soon as it reaches its high price peak, and that is exactly the point of the innovation that Alfred Winslow Jones made—taking long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline.

- Hedge fund managers manage the hedge fund. A hedge fund manager must find a way to create a competitive advantage to be successful, i.e., to create an advantage over rivals and the ability to generate greater value. It can be a very attractive career choice, as it can be very profitable if an individual excels at managing the fund.

On the other side, if a lot of hedge fund managers’ decisions turn out to be bad, they will not be paid and will gain a negative reputation. The best hedge fund managers make up one of the best paid professions across all industries. Hedge fund managers get a percentage of the returns they earn for investors, besides the management fee. This way of compensation makes hedge fund managers invest more aggressively in order to obtain greater returns, but on the other hand, that
