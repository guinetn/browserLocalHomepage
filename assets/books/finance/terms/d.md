## Derivative Instrument (Derivative)

A derivative instrument is a contract between two parties that specifies conditions under which payments are to be made between the parties.

A contract that changes in value in relation to the price movements of a related or underlying security, future or other physical instrument.
Option is the most common derivative instrument. 

Financial contracts such as futures, options and various securities that offer 
'synthetic' access to an underlying asset such as a commodity, stock market or fixed income 
security. The price movements of a derivative generally follow the price movements of the 
underlying asset but derivatives generally require only small amounts of capital (margin) 
to gain exposure to the underlying asset.

## Downside reduction
By employing long/ short investing and hedging strategies the investment may be able to provide protection against severe market drawdowns.

## Drawdown
An investment is said to be in a drawdown when its price falls below its last peak [see Net new highs]. The drawdown is the percentage drop in the price of an investment from its last peak price. The period between the peak level and the trough is called the length of the drawdown, and the period between the trough and the recapturing of the peak is called the recovery. The worst or maximum drawdown represents the greatest peak to trough decline over the life of an investment.


## Dividends
Another way to make money in stocks or funds is through dividends. 
Simply put a dividend is a way a company can share its earnings with its shareholders. 
So, if you happen to own a stock or a fund that offers a dividend let’s say the stock is 
worth $100 and it offers a 5%, over the course of a year you will be paid out $5 for owning that stock. 
Dividends could be subject to taxation: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc404
