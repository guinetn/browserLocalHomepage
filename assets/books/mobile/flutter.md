# Flutter

Compiles to machine code while coming with its own render engine. This promises a consistent cross-platform user experience as well as good performance. Neither Ionic nor React Native can compete with this.
Flutter projects are written in Dart, a language more or less unique to Flutter development. Dart is a pretty modern language, too, and it fits mobile development quite well.

the best part about Flutter is 
- user interface 
- user experience 
Flutter is very strong with Material Design and there are ready-to-use Material widgets to help create a good user experience with minimal effort. It’s all customizable with your fonts, colors, spacings, and a lot more, of course.
