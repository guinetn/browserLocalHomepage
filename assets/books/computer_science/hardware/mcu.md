# MCU - Microcontroller Unit

## Modules and concepts
You will be implementing your solutions to real problems thanks to these.

- Core related
CPU, Registers,Buses, Cache, Memory (Flash & SRAM/DRAM)

- MCU peripherals and features
- General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)
- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
- Clock & Oscillator
- Core Clock Control
- Watchdog
- Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) & Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)
- Direct Memory Access (DMA)
- EEPROM
- Real Time Clock (RTC) are some generic peripherals and features packed in most MCUs today.

- On-chip Communication Protocols
UART, I2C, SPI: Common communication protocols used in embedded systems.

- Interrupt Mechanism, Timers and Counters
Interrupt signals play a critical role in embedded world along with timers.
