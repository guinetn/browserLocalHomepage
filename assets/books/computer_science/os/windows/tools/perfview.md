## PerfView

CPU and memory performance-analysis tool
For investigating performance issues in code written for the .NET runtime.

Built on a library called Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent, that knows how to both collect and parse Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) data. Thus if there is any information that PerfView collects and processes that you would like to manipulate yourself programmatically, you would probably be interested in the TraceEvent Library Documentation
