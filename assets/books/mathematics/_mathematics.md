## Order of magnitude
Approximate measure of the number of digits that a number has in the commonly-used base-ten number system. It is equal to the whole number floor of logarithm (base 10). 
Magnitude of 1500 is 3 because 1500 = 1.5 × 10^3

If two numbers differ by one order of magnitude, one is about ten times larger than the other. If they differ by two orders of magnitude, they differ by a factor of about 100.
