RavenDB is a document database for the .NET platform, offering a flexible data model design to fit the needs of real world systems.

Forget about tables, rows, mappings or complicated data-layers. RavenDB is a document-oriented database you can just dump all your objects into.
Queries are amazingly fast and flexible.

RavenDB is a document database, which stores each document in JSON format. In a document database any entity can be stored as a document.
You don’t have to define in advance the schema of your data in order to store it, all you have to do is to give RavenDB an object and RavenDB will store it. Later in this post, I’ll show you what does a document looks like.
