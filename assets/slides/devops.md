# DevOps

Software development methodology history

1990 - Waterfall 
        1. Make product requirement documentation
        2. Build
        3. Start Tests 
        Testing and bug fixing can take time...
        Rigidity: What if the roadmap changes?
2001 - Agile Manifesto
        Iterative approach: continuously build features that add value, then test and release
        But agile fails joining developers and operations team
2008 - DevOpsDays to “evolving” Agile to create a bridge between two siloed teams

## DEVOPS

                            Continually provide a high-value software product to the customer 
                            at high speed while monitoring and improving the overall process 
                                             /
                           ------------------------------------------------------- 
Teams + process + tools → quality product in a fast continuous iterations delivery
-----------------------
        \
        Tools, practices, ideals that combine software development (Dev) and IT Operations (Ops) 
        into a single unifying force

        DevOps has to communicate with various departments inside the company and with the customers to deliver high-value products: Need for better collaboration between developers, operations teams, system administrators and system engineers. 

From agility to Move fast in a stable infrastructure:

* Code				 development and review, continuous integration tools
* Build				 control tools, code merging, build status
* Test				 and results determine performance
* Package			 repository, application pre-deployment staging
* Release			 management, release approvals, release automation
* Configure			 configuration and management, Infrastructure as Code tools
* Monitor			 performance monitoring, end user experience

Improve speed+quality of the entire production process
