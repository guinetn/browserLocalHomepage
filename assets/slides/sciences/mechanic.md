The three common classical mechanics approaches to solve problems
Ex: A ball is at ground level and tossed straight up with an initial velocity. The only force on the ball while it is in the air is the gravitational force.

## Newtonian

* we know the forces
* have a reasonable coordinate system

Newton’s Three Laws
F=ma
Sum(F) = 0
F21=F12

momentum: p=mv & F=dp/dt

That’s your equation of motion for a tossed ball: y = y0 + v0t - 1/2gt²

## Lagrangian

L = T - U

T Generalized kinetic energy
U Potential energy

## Hamiltonian

in quantum mechanics we use the Hamiltonian operator.
