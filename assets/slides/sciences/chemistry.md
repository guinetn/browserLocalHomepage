## chemical bond

#### 1. COVALENT BOND (STRONG)
2 atoms share electrons on the extrem layer
- polar (unbalanced electron engagement)
- no polar (balanced electron attraction)
Ex: these bonds make molecules

#### 2. IONIC BOND (STRONG)
Electrons transfert from betwwen ionic (electrostatic attraction)
Ex: NaCl = Na+Cl-

#### 3. INTERMOLECULAR (VAN DER WAALS) (WEAK)
Hydrogen bound
Hydrogen has a great positive charge attracted by an electronegative atom
More weak than the 2 previous

All these bonds are stables but during a chemical reaction there are intermediate states while atoms are
